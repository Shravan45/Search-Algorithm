# Search-Algorithms

This repository is a guide for learning how to implement various search algorithms.
The java project uses **Strategy Pattern** to switch between different algorithms.
User must pass the appropriate String in order to use the desired algorithm for searching.

List:
1) Linear Search
2) Binary Search (Using recursion and iteration)
3) Breadth First Search
